# Intentional — Values & Principles

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the foundational **values and guiding principles** that shape every aspect of Intentional’s work — from how we advise clients to how our brand looks, sounds, and behaves.
These principles guide decision-making across consulting engagements, design language, and communication style, ensuring every action reflects the Intentional ethos: **clarity, trust, competence, empathy, and purpose**.
They serve as the bridge between Intentional’s mission and its brand identity, connecting what we *believe* with how we *show up*.

## 2. Core Values

Each core value reflects a belief about how trust and results are built — with clients, customers, and colleagues alike.

### Integrity

We tell the truth, even when it’s uncomfortable.
We stand for what’s honorable in every interaction.
Saying “I don’t know” or “no” when appropriate builds more credibility than pretending to know the answer.

### People First

Customers and employees deserve dignity and respect in all interactions.
We meet people where they are and lead from there.
Servant leadership is the standard, not the exception.

### Excellence

We hold ourselves and our clients to high standards of clarity and execution.
Advice is evidence-based and operationally sound.
Reliability, resilience, and long-term thinking are signs of respect for the customer’s investment.
"Quality" is what we want customers to associated with our thinking and solutions.

### Practicality

We separate hype from reality.
We manage change to happen only as fast as organizations can absorb it.
The best solutions are those that survive contact with daily operations.

### Simplicity

Complex systems collapse under their own weight.
We favor simplicity because it creates space for clarity, learning, and progress.
Big improvements happen through small, deliberate steps.

### Collaboration

We listen first and speak last.
We create ownership among those who every project affects.
The goal isn’t to “deliver change” but to **build capability for change**.

### Customer-Driven

Customer needs — not internal convenience — set the direction.
Trust is the sacred currency of our relationship with clients and of our clients relationship with their customers.
Customers want to be heard first, helped second.

### Empowerment

We educate and enable rather than prescribe.
The outcome of every engagement should be stronger, more capable people and systems.
How we treat others models how we want organizations to operate.

### Innovation

We explore new combinations of ideas to achieve better results.
Innovation is not invention for its own sake — it’s *intentional creativity* with purpose.

## 3. Brand Principles

These principles translate Intentional’s values into *visible and experiential behaviors* — how the brand communicates, designs, and makes choices.

1. **Clarity over cleverness** — Say what we mean. Design what we say.
2. **Empathy in every interaction** — Respect the emotional context of every decision or problem.
3. **Substance first, style second** — Visual and verbal polish only matter when they amplify meaning.
4. **Consistency builds trust** — Our words, visuals, and actions should feel unmistakably Intentional.
5. **Purpose guides aesthetics** — Every color, font, and phrase exists to make complexity understandable and action achievable.

## 4. Application Examples

These examples illustrate how Intentional’s values and principles inform everyday actions and creative decisions.

- **In writing:** Keep sentences clear, direct, and actionable. Use plain English. Avoid jargon unless it’s explained.
- **In design:** Choose minimal, readable typefaces. Favor clean layouts and whitespace over ornamentation.
- **In consulting engagements:** Align client teams before executing. Frame recommendations in terms of long-term customer impact.
- **In relationships:** Say the difficult truth with respect. Prioritize mutual trust over short-term wins.
