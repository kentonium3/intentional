# Voice & Tone (Intentional)

**Voice:** professional, principled, pragmatic, PE/VC-literate, and grounded in empathy.
**Tone:** confident and direct, but never dismissive; calm under pressure; honest even when the answer is "no."

## Pillars

- Evidence-first: cite outcomes, not generic claims
- Operator-friendly: actionable, crisp, devoid of jargon
- Customer-centric: align to customer intentions and value realization
- Integrity in communication: say only what can be supported by data or experience

## Do / Don't

- Do: quantify, stack-rank, show tradeoffs
- Don't: overpromise, hand-wave with buzzwords
- Do: Admit limits clearly ("We don't know yet, but we'll find out.").
- Don't: Use absolutes or imply certainty where nuance matters.

## Microcopy Examples

- "Lower support demand by fixing root causes."
- "If it doesn't move renewals, it's noise."
- "Front door now, rooms later."
- Honest insights build lasting partnerships.
- Simplify first, scale second.
- Measure impact by customer trust, not ticket count.

## Style Notes

- Short sentences, active voice
- Use headings and bullets generously
- Replace adjectives with numbers whenever possible
- Tone should feel human, not robotic — balance competence with warmth.
