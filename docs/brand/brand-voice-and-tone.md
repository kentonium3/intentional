# Voice & Tone (Intentional)

**Voice:** professional, pragmatic, PE/VC-literate, customer-centric.
**Tone:** confident, direct, respectful; zero fluff.

## Pillars

- Evidence-first: cite outcomes, not generic claims
- Operator-friendly: actionable, crisp, devoid of jargon
- Customer-centric: align to customer intentions and value realization

## Do / Don't

- Do: quantify, stack-rank, show tradeoffs
- Don't: overpromise, hand-wave with buzzwords

## Microcopy Examples

- "Lower support demand by fixing root causes."
- "If it doesn't move renewals, it's noise."
- "Front door now, rooms later."

## Style Notes

- Short sentences, active voice
- Use headings and bullets generously
- Replace adjectives with numbers whenever possible
