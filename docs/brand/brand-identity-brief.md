# Brand Identity Brief (v1)

## Purpose

Define the visual and experiential identity of **Intentional** to ensure consistency between voice, tone, and design across all client- and market-facing materials.

## Brand Essence

| Attribute | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Core Idea** | "Create enduring customer connections" |
| **Keywords** | Trust, Alignment, Clarity, Competence, Empathy |
| **Emotional Goal** | Convey calm confidence, expertise, and humanity |
| **Design Challenge** | Balance executive credibility with approachability and warmth |

## Visual Personality Spectrum

| Dimension | Range | Target |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **Formality** | Casual ↔ Formal | Mid-to-high (executive, not stiff) |
| **Color Energy** | Muted ↔ Vibrant | Balanced — calm blues/greys + accent of purposeful color |
| **Typography** | Serif ↔ Sans-serif | Sans-serif primary (modern, legible); optional serif for emphasis |
| **Visual Density** | Sparse ↔ Dense | Open layouts, clear hierarchy |
| **Imagery** | Abstract ↔ Human | Subtle use of human/contextual imagery showing service alignment |

## Intended Impressions

1. **Trustworthy** – grounded in experience and ethics.
2. **Intentional** – deliberate design, nothing accidental.
3. **Expert** – communicates confidence without arrogance.
4. **Human** – empathetic tone, accessible visuals.
5. **Modern** – AI-forward but with restraint and simplicity.

## Design Inspirations (to Be expanded)

- Professional services brands known for clarity and restraint (e.g., IDEO, McKinsey Digital, Gainsight).
- Use of light/dark neutrals with one accent color signaling precision or insight.
- Typography pairing ideas: *Inter + Merriweather*, *Lato + Source Serif 4*, or *Montserrat + IBM Plex Serif.*

## Deliverables Influenced

- Website layout and color scheme
- Presentation templates and business documents
- Report covers (Intentional Index, Assessments)
- Online forms and automation UI cues

## Next Steps

1. Review and adjust desired brand attributes.
2. Identify preferred design references.
3. Finalize color palette and font choices in **Branding Kit Spec (v1)**.
4. Apply to **Website Copy V1** mockup for tone-visual alignment validation.
