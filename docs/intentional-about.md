# Founder's Note — Why I Started Intentional

After 30 years leading global support organizations, I saw too many SaaS companies treat Support as a cost center rather than a **strategic driver of retention and growth**. The truth is, Support speaks with more customers every day than any other function — hearing firsthand what works, what doesn’t, and what customers really value. That makes Support an **invaluable source of decision-making insight** for Product, Marketing, and every customer-facing team.

I founded **Intentional** in 2024 to help change that.

At Intentional, we help B2B SaaS companies:

- **Diagnose and benchmark** their support operations with the **Intentional Index™**, a proprietary maturity model.
- **Align intentions** across Support, Product, Sales, and Customer Success to create consistent, trustworthy customer experiences.
- **Turn customer feedback into strategy**, giving Support a measurable voice in roadmap prioritization and investment decisions.
- Build scalable systems and processes that transform Support from a reactive function into a **competitive advantage**.

Our mission is simple: **create enduring customer connections** that lead to higher renewals, stronger references, and more efficient growth.
