#

# Approach & Methodology {#approach-&-methodology}

## General Philosophy {#general-philosophy}

* Customer intentions relative to company promises and expectations are paramount in driving all assessment and change. A truly customer first approach.
* The collective intentions of customer contacts at all levels for a given customer determine customer expectations and the service requirements to meet or exceed.
* Employee intentions in all customer-impacting departments at all levels, and the alignment of those intentions, and execution in line with thise intentions, determine a company’s ability to deliver on customer expectations.
* Every support issue should be seen as a gap in the company’s product/services promise and its fulfillment of those promises.

## General Working Approach {#general-working-approach}

* Report to senior management
* Align on desired outcomes and timelines
* Align on resources and availability
* Align on communication cadence
* Follow solid change management practices
* Embed with Support management and team(s)
* Execute on changes
* Be transparent on changes and issues that arise
* Force clear decisions and tradeoffs
* Promote wins
* Maintain high ethical and working standards

## Expectation / Delivery Gap Analysis Report {#expectation-/-delivery-gap-analysis-report}

* Limited time and resources demand that all improvement efforts focus on only those changes with the highest return on investment for the business.
* The Intentional IndexTM report provides a stack ranked list of improvement targets with the greatest return on customers satisfaction, capacity, support reduction, and cost. This creates an objectively prioritized list around which management can agree to take action.
* Part of this process is to bring the voice of the customer to those in the company who may not experience first-hand customer feedback in the way Support does.

## Customer/Product Feedback {#customer/product-feedback}

* Intentional’s Product Feedback methodology provides an objectively quantified ranking of product and service issues for Product Management to incorporate into roadmap decisions.
* The goal is to create a high signal to noise ratio so Product Management may confidently make product roadmap decisions that lower support demand, lower support costs, and increase customer satisfaction of their product.
* This gives Support agency and influence within the organization as a proxy for the customer to those not typically close to customers and their issues.
* The methodology avoids the “squeaky wheel” dynamic that has the loudest customer or salesperson drive product priorities and resource utilization against the best interests of the company and of the customer base as a whole.

## Priority Projects {#priority-projects}

* The results of the Intentional Index report provide management with choices on what changes to prioritize within departments.
* Typically management will choose one major change with a clear desired outcome.
* Intentional and client management negotiate on the scope and expected outcome of the project so it fits within the engagement period. This is documented in a signed statement of work (SOW) as an addendum to the engagement agreement.
* Intentional then works with the organization’s designated resources to implement changes. Program and Project management are a key Intentional role to play until the desired result is achieved or the engagement ends with the customer in control of the process until completion.

# Sales {#sales}

## Positioning {#positioning}

* Intentional, specifically Kent Gale, is positioned as a capable, experienced leader and resource able to assist companies with any of the issues in the [Core benefits clients receive](<#how-you-measure-success>) section above.
* Intentional is not a comprehensive service delivery technology expert but is capable of leading selection processes in full cooperation with the client’s IT department to ensure proper ownership and coherence with IT’s management practices.
* A sale involves an initial prospect interview with the client to determine if there is a fit between the client’s needs and Intentional’s capabilities. This may be done remotely or a client may pay for an on-site one day discovery consultation.

## Networking {#networking}

* Industry leaders known to me have recommended a marketing approach of networking with private equity contacts and venture capital contacts because they have portfolios of companies that may be in need of Intentional’s services and they have a vested interest in the companies’ success. They also have influence in creating invitations for initial conversations with senior executives at these firms.
* My personal network is currently limited but I do have individuals willing to vouch for my work that I can leverage to get a start.

## Prospect Management {#prospect-management}

* My intention is to employ a combination of personal and systematized follow up actions with prospects to maintain some level of awareness of Intentional.
* I have HubSpot

## Engagement Packaging {#engagement-packaging}

* The intention is to sell three month engagements, paid up front. (as advised by Ron Pruett)
* I will sell one month engagements to get started
* The longer the engagement the better. Customers may extend the engagement indefinitely.

# Marketing {#marketing}

## Positioning {#positioning-1}

* Position as a serious expert with insight into the challenges of delivering excellent service for SaaS products.
* Position as a consultant available for serious engagements by companies who already see or desire to have Support be a strategic competitive advantage. Good targets are rapidly expanding businesses and businesses in tight competitive markets.
* (Need to be open to doing speaking engagements, conference panels, ½ day on-site seminars. I would need to prepare materials for these activities.

## Website {#website}

* The purpose of the website is to position Intentional’s services and create credibility with prospects and network referrals.
* The current state of the site is it has placeholder page

### Desire Features {#desire-features}

* Simple, straightforward, uncluttered design that gets straight to the point of what we do.

# Scratch Pad Area {#scratch-pad-area}

* Growing companies, especially engineering oriented companies, often do not treat Support as integral to their go-to-market strategy and quickly outgrow Support’s initial capabilities. This results in poor service which impacts company reputation and renewals. At a certain pain level, the company realizes it must solve their support issue.
  * Companies often do not understand their “support issues” are actually product and customer expectation setting issues and therefore focus on solving the wrong issues when trying to correct.
  * To get a comprehensive and professional assessment of all factors driving the company’s customer Support experience from an experienced, outside perspective.
  * To have a stack ranked list of improvement or maturation opportunities with the greatest payback
  * To have an additional experienced leadership resource from the outside to focus solely on executing the top change priorities
  * To tap into 30+ years of experience in delivering excellent customer service for SaaS products in a global market.
  * To provide mentoring to Support leadership and staff on hiring, process, and customer management.
